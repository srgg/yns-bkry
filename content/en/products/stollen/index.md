Stollen is a cherished German Christmas bread, steeped in tradition and brimming with festive charm. Lightly dusted with powdered sugar—a nod to its symbolic origins—this holiday classic is as meaningful as it is delicious.

We elevate tradition with rum-soaked dried fruits like raisins, cranberries, and apricots, paired with crunchy almonds, vibrant citrus zest, and a perfectly balanced blend of warm spices. Love marzipan? You can opt to have it added for an extra touch of indulgence.

Each loaf is generously brushed with French butter, orange liqueur, and rum after baking, giving it an irresistibly tender crumb and rich, aromatic flavor. For the best experience, our Stollen is aged for 2-3 weeks, allowing the rum-soaked fruits to deeply infuse the bread. Prefer it fresh? It’s equally delightful straight from the oven—warm, fragrant, and ready to savor.

Crafted without artificial additives, our Stollen is pure holiday magic—perfect for sharing at festive gatherings or enjoying during cozy winter evenings.
